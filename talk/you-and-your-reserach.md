At a seminar in the Bell Communications Research Colloquia Series, Dr. Richard W. Hamming, a Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and a retired Bell Labs scientist, gave a very interesting and stimulating talk, 'You and Your Research' to an overflow audience of some 200 Bellcore staff members and visitors at the Morris Research and Engineering Center on March 7, 1986. This talk centered on Hamming's observations and research on the question "Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?" From his more than forty years of experience, thirty of which were at Bell Laboratories, he has made a number of direct observations, asked very pointed questions of scientists about what, how, and why they did things, studied the lives of great scientists and great contributions, and has done introspection and studied theories of creativity. The talk is about what he has learned in terms of the properties of the individual scientists, their abilities, traits, working habits, attitudes, and philosophy.

In order to make the information in the talk more widely available, the tape recording that was made of that talk was carefully transcribed. This transcription includes the discussions which followed in the question and answer period. As with any talk, the transcribed version suffers from translation as all the inflections of voice and the gestures of the speaker are lost; one must listen to the tape recording to recapture that part of the presentation. While the recording of Richard Hamming's talk was completely intelligible, that of some of the questioner's remarks were not. Where the tape recording was not intelligible I have added in parentheses my impression of the questioner's remarks. Where there was a question and I could identify the questioner, I have checked with each to ensure the accuracy of my interpretation of their remarks.

## INTRODUCTION OF DR. RICHARD W. HAMMING

As a speaker in the Bell Communications Research Colloquium Series, Dr. Richard W. Hamming of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, was introduced by Alan G. Chynoweth, Vice President, Applied Research, Bell Communications Research.

Alan G. Chynoweth: Greetings colleagues, and also to many of our former colleagues from Bell Labs who, I understand, are here to be with us today on what I regard as a particularly felicitous occasion. It gives me very great pleasure indeed to introduce to you my old friend and colleague from many many years back, Richard Hamming, or Dick Hamming as he has always been know to all of us.

Dick is one of the all time greats in the mathematics and computer science arenas, as I'm sure the audience here does not need reminding. He received his early education at the Universities of Chicago and Nebraska, and got his Ph.D. at Illinois; he then joined the Los Alamos project during the war. Afterwards, in 1946, he joined Bell Labs. And that is, of course, where I met Dick - when I joined Bell Labs in their physics research organization. In those days, we were in the habit of lunching together as a physics group, and for some reason this strange fellow from mathematics was always pleased to join us. We were always happy to have him with us because he brought so many unorthodox ideas and views. Those lunches were stimulating, I can assure you.

While our professional paths have not been very close over the years, nevertheless I've always recognized Dick in the halls of Bell Labs and have always had tremendous admiration for what he was doing. I think the record speaks for itself. It is too long to go through all the details, but let me point out, for example, that he has written seven books and of those seven books which tell of various areas of mathematics and computers and coding and information theory, three are already well into their second edition. That is testimony indeed to the prolific output and the stature of Dick Hamming.

I think I last met him - it must have been about ten years ago - at a rather curious little conference in Dublin, Ireland where we were both speakers. As always, he was tremendously entertaining. Just one more example of the provocative thoughts that he comes up with: I remember him saying, "There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot think." Well, with Dick Hamming around, we don't need a computer. I think that we are in for an extremely entertaining talk.

## THE TALK: "You and Your Research" by Dr. Richard W. Hamming

It's a pleasure to be here. I doubt if I can live up to the Introduction. The title of my talk is, "You and Your Research." It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research. I could give a talk on the other subject - but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about great research. And for the sake of describing great research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work. It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean those kinds of things which we perceive are significant things. Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information theory, any number of outstanding theories - that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.

很高兴能来到这里。我怀疑自己能否做好这个介绍。我演讲的题目是，“你和你的研究”。这不是关于研究项目的管理，而是关于你们如何独自从事研究。我可以讲些别的话题，但这次不是，这是对你们讲的。我不是在讲那些平淡无奇的普通研究项目，我说的是伟大的研究。为了清楚的说明什么是伟大的研究，我可能会偶尔提及诺贝尔奖级别的工作。不管有没有获得诺贝尔奖，我意思是那些我们都承认具有重大意义的工作。相对论、[香农](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%8B%E5%8A%B3%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E9%A6%99%E5%86%9C)的[信息论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E8%AE%BA)，类似这样的杰出理论。我要讲的是这种研究。

Now, how did I come to do this study? At Los Alamos I was brought in to run the computing machines which other people had got going, so those scientists and physicists could get back to business. I saw I was a stooge. I saw that although physically I was the same, they were different. And to put the thing bluntly, I was envious. I wanted to know why they were so different from me. I saw Feynman up close. I saw Fermi and Teller. I saw Oppenheimer. I saw Hans Bethe: he was my boss. I saw quite a few very capable people. I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.

那么，我该如何开始做研究呢？在[洛斯阿拉莫斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B4%9B%E6%96%AF%E9%98%BF%E6%8B%89%E8%8E%AB%E6%96%AF%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4)，我当时和其他一些人一起来保证计算机正常运转，好让那些科学家和物理学家有时间干正事。我只是个打下手的。尽管大家都是人，但是他们不一样。说实话，我当时很嫉妒。我想知道他们为什么跟我不一样。我在近处见过[费曼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%90%86%E6%9F%A5%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E8%B2%BB%E6%9B%BC)，我见过[费米](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%81%A9%E9%87%8C%E7%A7%91%C2%B7%E8%B4%B9%E7%B1%B3)和[泰勒](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%84%9B%E5%BE%B7%E8%8F%AF%C2%B7%E6%B3%B0%E5%8B%92)，我见过[奥本海默](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BD%97%E4%BC%AF%E7%89%B9%C2%B7%E5%A5%A5%E6%9C%AC%E6%B5%B7%E9%BB%98)，我见过[汉斯·贝特](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%89%E6%96%AF%C2%B7%E8%B4%9D%E7%89%B9)——他是我老板。我见过不少极有才干的人，所以我非常感兴趣的是，在那些正在做事和已经作成事的人之间，到底有那些差别。

When I came to Bell Labs, I came into a very productive department. Bode was the department head at the time; Shannon was there, and there were other people. I continued examining the questions, "Why?" and "What is the difference?" I continued subsequently by reading biographies, autobiographies, asking people questions such as: "How did you come to do this?" I tried to find out what are the differences. And that's what this talk is about.

当我来到[贝尔实验室](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B4%9D%E5%B0%94%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4)，我来到一个非常有生产力的部门。[波德](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%A8%E5%BE%B7%E9%87%8C%E5%85%8B%C2%B7%E9%9F%8B%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E6%B3%A2%E5%BE%B7)是当时部门的头，香农也在那，还有其他一些人。我继续研究那些问题，“为什么？”和“有什么样的差别？”我后来看了他们的传记和自传，跟那里的人问了诸如“你是怎么来这的？”之类的问题。我试图找出到底有什么不同。这也是今天要演讲的内容。

Now, why is this talk important? I think it is important because, as far as I know, each of you has one life to live. Even if you believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant things in this one life, however you define significant? I'm not going to define it - you know what I mean. I will talk mainly about science because that is what I have studied. But so far as I know, and I've been told by others, much of what I say applies to many fields. Outstanding work is characterized very much the same way in most fields, but I will confine myself to science.

那么，为什么这个演讲很重要？我想重要之处在于，据我所知，你们每个人都只能活一次。即使你相信有来世，这对你的每一次人生也没有任何帮助。所以为什么不在这辈子就做些伟大的事情呢，然而你是怎么定义“伟大”的？我不想做定义，你懂我的意思。我主要谈谈科学方面，因为我是做这个的。据我所知，很多人也跟我说过，我讲的这些也适用于其他领域。在很多领域，杰出的工作都有相同的特点，就我个人而言我只想谈谈科学领域。

In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do first-class work." Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do something significant."

为了让你感受到独立性，我得用第一人生来说。我希望你放掉谦逊、对自己说“没错，我想做第一流的工作”你都不需要做假设，我们的社会一定会对那些立志要真正做事的人皱起眉头。假设幸运降临到你头上，你有机会可以做大事了。好吧，这说起来好像挺蠢的。我是说，你为什么不直接立志去做大事呢。不需要讲给跟其他人，但要跟自己说：“没错，我想成就些大事”。

In order to get to the second stage, I have to drop modesty and talk in the first person about what I've seen, what I've done, and what I've heard. I'm going to talk about people, some of whom you know, and I trust that when we leave, you won't quote me as saying some of the things I said.

为了达到第二个层次，我需要放掉谦逊，用第一人称谈论我所看到的，我所做到的，以及我所听到的。我打算讲一些人，有些人你们认识，并且我相信等散会后你们不会拿我这些话说事。

Let me start not logically, but psychologically. I find that the major objection is that people think great science is done by luck. It's all a matter of luck. Well, consider Einstein. Note how many different things he did that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn't it a little too repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn't do just information theory. Several years before, he did some other good things and some which are still locked up in the security of cryptography. He did many good things.

我先不从逻辑上，而是从心理上讲起。我发现主要的误区在于，人们觉得伟大的科学研究都是靠的好运。什么都跟好运气有关。好吧，想想爱因斯坦，要知道他做了那么多了不起的事情，全是靠运气么？这么说是不是有点太没劲了？想想香农，在很多年前他还没提出信息论的时候，他已经做了很多很棒的工作，有些到现在还能保证在密码学上是安全的。他做了很多了不起的工作。

You see again and again, that it is more than one thing from a good person. Once in a while a person does only one thing in his whole life, and we'll talk about that later, but a lot of times there is repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything. And I will cite Pasteur who said, "Luck favors the prepared mind." And I think that says it the way I believe it. There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn't. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.

你可以一次又一次看到，一个很棒的人做出不止一次很棒的事。而有些人一辈子也就能做一次。稍候我们会谈到，而且会重复很多次。我要强调好运气管不了所有事情。就像[巴斯德](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B7%AF%E6%98%93%C2%B7%E5%B7%B4%E6%96%AF%E5%BE%B7)说的，“好运会眷顾有准备的人”这就是我所坚信的。确实有运气的因素，但其实不是你们想的那种。做好准备的人迟早会发现重要的事情并做下去。是的，这才是所谓的运气。特定的那件事，你做了就是运气，你去做别的了就是不走运。

For example, when I came to Bell Labs, I shared an office for a while with Shannon. At the same time he was doing information theory, I was doing coding theory. It is suspicious that the two of us did it at the same place and at the same time - it was in the atmosphere. And you can say, "Yes, it was luck." On the other hand you can say, "But why of all the people in Bell Labs then were those the two who did it?" Yes, it is partly luck, and partly it is the prepared mind; but 'partly' is the other thing I'm going to talk about. So, although I'll come back several more times to luck, I want to dispose of this matter of luck as being the sole criterion whether you do great work or not. I claim you have some, but not total, control over it. And I will quote, finally, Newton on the matter. Newton said, "If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results."

举个例子，当我来到贝尔实验室，有段时间我跟香农共用一间办公室。那时候他在研究信息论，我在研究编码理论。有意思的是我们在同一时间同一地点在做相同的事情，当时就是那种氛围。你可以说，“瞧，这就是运气”但是你也可以说“为什么贝尔实验室有那么多人而只有他俩在做这方面研究？”是的，一部分是运气，另一部分是做好准备的人。但是“部分”是我要谈的另外一码事。尽管我谈到好几次运气，但我想，是否完全受运气的摆布，可以作为有没有在做大事的唯一标准。我觉得你可以有一些，但不要指望完全掌控运气。最后，我想引用牛顿对此的看法，牛顿说，“如果其他人也想我这样刻苦思考，他们也会得到类似的结论”

One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them. For example, Einstein, somewhere around 12 or 14, asked himself the question, "What would a light wave look like if I went with the velocity of light to look at it?" Now he knew that electromagnetic theory says you cannot have a stationary local maximum. But if he moved along with the velocity of light, he would see a local maximum. He could see a contradiction at the age of 12, 14, or somewhere around there, that everything was not right and that the velocity of light had something peculiar. Is it luck that he finally created special relativity? Early on, he had laid down some of the pieces by thinking of the fragments. Now that's the necessary but not sufficient condition. All of these items I will talk about are both luck and not luck.

包括伟大的科学家在内的很多人里，都具有一种特质。在他们年轻的时候就开始独立思考并激励他们向前。举个例子，爱因斯坦，大概 12 或者 14 岁时候就问他自己,“如果我跟光一样快，这时候光看起来是什么样子的？”他知道电磁理论说你不能有一个稳定的局部最大值。但如果他能达到光速运动，他就会看到局部最大值。他在 12 或者 14 岁就能看到这个矛盾，其实所有人都错了，光速有些特殊。是好运气让他最终创立了狭义相对论么？其实在那之前，他已经做了很多思考，得到一些关于理论的碎片。这算是必要条件但不是充分条件。我所要讲的就是跟运气有关和无关的。

How about having lots of 'brains'? It sounds good. Most of you in this room probably have more than enough brains to do first-class work. But great work is something else than mere brains. Brains are measured in various ways. In mathematics, theoretical physics, astrophysics, typically brains correlates to a great extent with the ability to manipulate symbols. And so the typical IQ test is apt to score them fairly high. On the other hand, in other fields it is something different. For example, Bill Pfann, the fellow who did zone melting, came into my office one day. He had this idea dimly in his mind about what he wanted and he had some equations. It was pretty clear to me that this man didn't know much mathematics and he wasn't really articulate. His problem seemed interesting so I took it home and did a little work. I finally showed him how to run computers so he could compute his own answers. I gave him the power to compute. He went ahead, with negligible recognition from his own department, but ultimately he has collected all the prizes in the field. Once he got well started, his shyness, his awkwardness, his inarticulateness, fell away and he became much more productive in many other ways. Certainly he became much more articulate.

如果拥有许多的“头脑”会怎么样？听起来不错。在座的各位里，很多人拥有远不止做一流工作的头脑。但是做大事不仅仅是要有头脑。头脑可以用很多种类方式来衡量。在数学、理论物理、天体物理等方面，头脑通常说的是能在相当大程度上处理符号的能力。所以在典型的 IQ 测试中可以得到相当高的分数。另一方面，其他领域有些不同。比方说，[比尔·普凡](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A8%81%E5%BB%89%C2%B7%E5%8A%A0%E5%BE%B7%E7%B4%8D%C2%B7%E6%99%AE%E5%87%A1)，实现[区域熔炼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%9F%E7%86%94%E7%85%89)的那位。有一天他走进我的办公室，他对于想做的事情，脑中有一些模糊的想法，和一些方程。我看得很明白，他不太擅长数学，也没法清晰表达。他提出的问题有点意思，于是我把问题带回家做了点小工作。最终我给他展示如何运行计算机，这样他就能算出自己想要的答案了。我给了他计算的能力，他继续干下去，而他所在的部门并不看好他，最终他收获了开创这个领域的全部荣誉。当他有了一个良好的开始，他的腼腆、笨拙、表达不清，这些问题都逐渐消失了。他在很多方面都有长进。当然他的表达也更加清晰有力了。

And I can cite another person in the same way. I trust he isn't in the audience, i.e. a fellow named Clogston. I met him when I was working on a problem with John Pierce's group and I didn't think he had much. I asked my friends who had been with him at school, "Was he like that in graduate school?" "Yes," they replied. Well I would have fired the fellow, but J. R. Pierce was smart and kept him on. Clogston finally did the Clogston cable. After that there was a steady stream of good ideas. One success brought him confidence and courage.

我还想再说个人，希望他今天不在场。这位同事叫[克拉斯顿](http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/clogston-albert.pdf)，遇见他时我正在[约翰·皮尔斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%84%E7%BF%B0%C2%B7%E7%BE%85%E8%B3%93%E6%A3%AE%C2%B7%E7%9A%AE%E7%88%BE%E6%96%AF)的组里，彼此并不熟悉。我问我朋友有谁和他是同学。“他毕业的学校么？”“是的”，他们回答到。好吧我打算开了他，但是皮尔斯很明智，留下了他。克拉斯顿终于做出了克拉斯顿电缆。之后他就一直不断稳定的产出好点子，只要一次成功就带给了他信心和勇气。

One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to think of his major theorem. He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn't know what to do so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the impossible question, "What would the average random code do?" He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code. Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.

成功科学家的典型特征之一就是有勇气。当你有勇气去坚信你可以解决重要的问题，那你就能做到。如果你觉得自己不行，几乎可以肯定你都不会去尝试。勇气就是香农最为耀眼的特征之一。你只要想到他主要的理论贡献，他希望创造一种编码的方法，但他不知道应该怎么去做，于是他生成了随机编码，之后就卡住了。接着他提出了一个不太现实的问题，“平均随机码可以用来做什么？”然后证明，平均码的性质良好，前提是至少有一个好编码。如果一个人不是拥有无限的勇气，怎么会去挑战这些思想？这就是大科学家的特征，他们有勇气。他们会在难以置信的困难面前继续前行，反反复复不断思考。

Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. Einstein did things very early, and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work. Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young. It is not that they don't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early. On the other hand, in music, politics and literature, often what we consider their best work was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale, but age has some effect.

年龄是物理学家深感忧虑的另一个因素。他们总是说做研究要趁年轻，否则就没机会了。爱因斯坦做研究时非常年轻，所有研究量子物理的科学家们，在做出他们最棒的研究时都年轻得不可思议。大部分数学家，理论物理学家和天体物理学家们，都是在年轻时候做出我们觉得最棒的贡献。不是说他们老了就做不出好的研究，而做出最有价值那部分时通常都很年轻。另一方面来说，在音乐、政治和文学方面，我们总觉得他们最好的作品通常都出得很晚。我不知道哪些领域适用这个规则，但年龄确实会有影响。

But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work. You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when he got a Nobel Prize. The day the prize was announced we all assembled in Arnold Auditorium; all three winners got up and made speeches. The third one, Brattain, practically with tears in his eyes, said, "I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain." Well I said to myself, "That is nice." But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could only work on great problems.

那么我来说下为什么年龄为什么会有影响。首先，如果你工作很出色，你会置身于各种委员会而没法再做别的工作了。我在[布拉顿](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%83%E5%B0%94%E7%89%B9%C2%B7%E5%B8%83%E6%8B%89%E9%A1%BF)拿了诺贝尔奖后见过他。宣布颁奖的那天我们都聚集在 Arnold 礼堂。三位获奖者依次起身发言，第三位是布拉顿，眼泪含眼圈地说到，“我知道诺贝尔奖效应，但我不会让他影响到我，我还是那个老沃尔特·布拉顿。”我对自己说，“那很棒”可几周后我就能看到他开始受到影响了。他现在只能为那些大问题工作了。

When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I will give you my favorite quotation of many years. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any institution has created, judged by what they did before they came and judged by what they did after. Not that they weren't good afterwards, but they were superb before they got there and were only good afterwards.

如果你已经成名了，就很难再在那些小问题上做研究了。香农也不例外。做出信息论之后，你又能再来点什么呢？伟大的科学家经常犯这个错误。他们没法再去栽培那些最终可以长成橡树的小种子。他们会尝试直接搞定大事，但没法这样做。这就解释了，为什么成名太早人就废了。其实我想举个这些年来我最喜欢的一个例子。[普林斯顿高等研究院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%99%AE%E6%9E%97%E6%96%AF%E9%A1%BF%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E9%99%A2)，要我说，根据那些卓越的科学家们进去前和出来后的样子做判断，它毁掉的比其他任何一家研究院培养出来的都多。也不是说出来后就不行了，但是他们进去前可都是超牛，出来后也就一般牛了。

This brings up the subject, out of order perhaps, of working conditions. What most people think are the best working conditions, are not. Very clearly they are not because people are often most productive when working conditions are bad. One of the better times of the Cambridge Physical Laboratories was when they had practically shacks - they did some of the best physics ever.

这又引出了工作条件的话题，可能说得乱了点。大多数人想要到的是最好的工作条件，其实不对。很显然，很多人最有生产力的时期通常工作条件挺差。[剑桥物理实验室](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%A1%E6%96%87%E8%BF%AA%E8%AE%B8%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4)在最辉煌的时期几乎只有棚屋，但是他们做出了当时最棒的物理学研究。

I give you a story from my own private life. Early on it became evident to me that Bell Laboratories was not going to give me the conventional acre of programming people to program computing machines in absolute binary. It was clear they weren't going to. But that was the way everybody did it. I could go to the West Coast and get a job with the airplane companies without any trouble, but the exciting people were at Bell Labs and the fellows out there in the airplane companies were not. I thought for a long while about, "Did I want to go or not?" and I wondered how I could get the best of two possible worlds. I finally said to myself, "Hamming, you think the machines can do practically everything. Why can't you make them write programs?" What appeared at first to me as a defect forced me into automatic programming very early. What appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint, turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have. But you are not likely to think that when you first look the thing and say, "Gee, I'm never going to get enough programmers, so how can I ever do any great programming?"

我向你们分享一个我私人的小故事。早时候对我很明白，贝尔实验室不打算给我 通常 程序员用绝对二进制给计算机编程，很显然他们不打算这么着。但是有办法让所有人都做到。我可以去西海岸在飞机公司找份工作，这一点都不麻烦。但是最棒的人才都在贝尔实验室，而飞机公司的同事里不会有。我思考了很久，“我到底想不想去？”我怀疑如何在两类世界里做出最佳选择。最终我对自己说。“汉明，你认为机器可以做几乎所有事情，为什么你不能给它们制作程序呢？”最开始显露出的缺陷迫使我很早就开始自动编程。那些通常看起来像缺陷的东西，换个视角之后，转变成为你最有价值的财富之一。但刚看到这东西时，你不太可能想到这些，并且说“哇哦，我不可能找到足够的程序员，那我怎么能做出任何伟大的程序呢？”

And there are many other stories of the same kind; Grace Hopper has similar ones. I think that if you look carefully you will see that often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset. For example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not. They then turned it around the other way and said, "But of course, this is what it is" and got an important result. So ideal working conditions are very strange. The ones you want aren't always the best ones for you.

还有很多这种故事。[格蕾丝·霍普](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%91%9B%E9%BA%97%E7%B5%B2%C2%B7%E9%9C%8D%E6%99%AE)也有个类似的。我想，如果你仔细观察就会发现，通常伟大的科学家会调整问题，把缺陷变为财富。举个例子，很多科学家发现无法解决一个问题后，会去研究为什么不行。接着他们换了个角度然后说，“当然，这就是问题所在”，并做出了重要结果。所以理想的工作条件有些奇怪。你想要到未必是最适合你的。

Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, "How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?" He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, "You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years." I simply slunk out of the office!

说到动力，你会发现大多数伟大的科学家都有着巨大的动力。我在贝尔实验室跟[约翰·图基](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BA%A6%E7%BF%B0%C2%B7%E5%9B%BE%E5%9F%BA)共事了十年。他就有着巨大的动力。在我入职三四年后的一天，我发现约翰·图基比我略微年轻一些。约翰是格天才，而我明显不是。我冲进波德的办公室跟他说：“像我这样年纪的人怎样能做得跟约翰·图基一样多？”他背靠在椅子上，把手放在头后面，微微咧嘴一笑，说“如果你像他一样努力工作这么多年，你会很惊讶自己可以懂那么多的，汉明。”我就从办公室灰溜溜的出去了！

What Bode was saying was this: "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest." Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no question about this.

就像波德说的：”知识和生产力像是复利。“两个能力差不多的人，其中一位比另一位每年多干 10%，最后的产出可能翻倍还多。你知道得越多，就学得越多；你学得越多，就做得越多；你做得越多，就有更多机会——这非常像复利。我没法告诉你具体利率，但那利率一定很可观。假设两个人的能力相同，其中一位日复一日的管理时间、每天多思考一小时，那么在他的生涯中会有异常多的产出。我把博德的话牢记在心。多年来，我花了非常多的时间更努力的工作，于是我发现，其实我可以做得更多。我不想在我妻子面前说这些，但有时候我确实冷落了她。我需要学习。如果你确实在做你想要做的事情，你必须忽略其他事物。这对我不是问题。


On this matter of drive Edison says, "Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration." He may have been exaggerating, but the idea is that solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently applied is what does it. That's the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere. I've often wondered why so many of my good friends at Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did, didn't have so much to show for it. The misapplication of effort is a very serious matter. Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.

关于动力爱迪生曾经说过，“天才就是 99% 汗水加上 1% 灵感“，可能他说得有些夸张，但扎实工作、稳步推进，确实可以让你走得出奇的远。扎实的下足功夫，再多干一点，以及如何聪明地做事情。问题就在这里：如何掌控、不要过犹不及、最终迷失方向。我常常在想，在贝尔实验室，为什么我的好友里有这么多人远比我工作得更努力，却没有做出什么成果。瞎使劲可能是个严重问题。只是苦干是没用的，还要聪明的做事。

There's another trait on the side which I want to talk about; that trait is ambiguity. It took me a while to discover its importance. Most people like to believe something is or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it. Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind. When you find apparent flaws you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work.

我想谈到另外一项特质，这特质有些含糊。我花了很长时间后才明白它的重要性。大部分人相信有些事情非黑即白。而伟大的科学家们则会容忍那些含糊。他们相信理论可以往前推进，但也保持的充分怀疑。如果出现问题或者致命的错误，他们也可以继续前行、用新创造的理论来替代它。过于自信，你会忽略其中的缺陷；过于怀疑，你甚至都没法开始。这其中要保持一个优美的平衡。但是大部分伟大的科学家们都会很清楚，为什么他们的理论是正确的，同时他们也很清楚有些不太合适的地方，他们不会忘掉那些问题。达尔文在自传中写到，他发现有必要写下所有和他的信念相悖的那些证据，否则它们会从脑海中消失。当你发现了明显的瑕疵，你需要留意并保持跟进那些事物，并留意如何解释这些瑕疵，或者理论需要被修改以适应它们。通常大贡献（大贡献很少是靠小数点多一位来做到的）来自于感情上的投入。大多数伟大的科学家完全致力于解决他们的问题。那些没有变得坚定的人很少会产生出色的一流工作。

Now again, emotional commitment is not enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I think I can tell you the reason why. Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally to saying, "creativity comes out of your subconscious." Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.

话又说回来，感情投入还不够。显然，这是个必要条件。但我想告诉你的是为什么。每个研究过创造力的人最终都会说：“创造力来自于你的潜意识。”无论如何，突然就有了。它就是出现了。好吧，我们对潜意识知之甚少，但是有一件事你知道得很清楚：梦也来自于潜意识。你能意识到，在很大程度上，梦是对白天经历的重现。如果你日复一日地沉浸和投入在某个主题上，你的潜意识除了去解决问题其他什么都做不了。当某天早上你醒来，或者是某天下午，答案就这样出来了。对于那些没有投入在他们当前问题的人，潜意识在其他事情上瞎混，而没有产出重大结果。所以自我管理的方法就是，当你碰到一个真正重要的问题时，不要让其他任何事情抓住你到注意力——在你的问题上保持思考，保证你的潜意识很饥饿，让它只能去解决你的问题。这样你就可以平静的去睡觉，等早上答案就有了，而且是白捡的。

Now Alan Chynoweth mentioned that I used to eat at the physics table. I had been eating with the mathematicians and I found out that I already knew a fair amount of mathematics; in fact, I wasn't learning much. The physics table was, as he said, an exciting place, but I think he exaggerated on how much I contributed. It was very interesting to listen to Shockley, Brattain, Bardeen, J. B. Johnson, Ken McKay and other people, and I was learning a lot. But unfortunately a Nobel Prize came, and a promotion came, and what was left was the dregs. Nobody wanted what was left. Well, there was no use eating with them!

[Alan Chynoweth](https://ethw.org/Alan_G._Chynoweth)提到我曾经跟物理学家们一起吃饭。我也曾经跟数学家们吃饭，但发现我已经懂了不少数学，其实我没学到多少。但是物理学家的饭桌，像他说的，是个妙不可言的地方，但我觉得他夸大了我的贡献。听[肖克利](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A8%81%E5%BB%89%C2%B7%E8%82%96%E5%85%8B%E5%88%A9)、布拉顿、[巴丁](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BA%A6%E7%BF%B0%C2%B7%E5%B7%B4%E4%B8%81)、[J.B.约翰逊](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bertrand_Johnson)、[肯·麦凯](https://www.nae.edu/28906/Dr-Kenneth-G-McKay)他们那些人的聊天非常有意思，我学到了很多。但不幸的是诺贝尔奖来了，晋升来了，剩下的都是渣了。没人想要这些剩下的，跟他们吃饭没什么用！

Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time. I went over and said, "Do you mind if I join you?" They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And I started asking, "What are the important problems of your field?" And after a week or so, "What important problems are you working on?" And after some more time I came in one day and said, "If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?" I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! That was in the spring.

餐厅的另一边是化学家的饭桌。我还曾经跟其中一位共事过，[Dave McCall](https://academictree.org/chemistry/peopleinfo.php?pid=716915)，当时他还正在追求我们的秘书。我走过去说，“我能加入你们么？”他们没法拒绝，于是我就跟他们一起吃了一段时间。然后我开始发问了：“你们领域都有哪些重要问题呢？“大概过了一个星期我又问，”你们在解决哪些重要问题呢？“又过了更久，有一天我过来说，“如果你做的事情不重要，或者你不认为这事会有重要的结果，那你在贝尔实验室工作是在图什么啊？“之后我就不再受欢迎了。我不得不去找人吃饭！那是春天的事。

In the fall, Dave McCall stopped me in the hall and said, "Hamming, that remark of yours got underneath my skin. I thought about it all summer, i.e. what were the important problems in my field. I haven't changed my research," he says, "but I think it was well worthwhile." And I said, "Thank you Dave," and went on. I noticed a couple of months later he was made the head of the department. I noticed the other day he was a Member of the National Academy of Engineering. I noticed he has succeeded. I have never heard the names of any of the other fellows at that table mentioned in science and scientific circles. They were unable to ask themselves, "What are the important problems in my field?"

到了秋天的时候，Dave McCall 在餐厅叫住了我，然后说：“海明，你的话让我醍醐灌顶。我整个夏天都在思考这个问题，那就是我所在的领域里，什么才是重要的问题。我没改变我的研究。”他说，“但是我认为这是非常值得的。”于是我说：“谢谢你戴夫。”然后各干各的了。我注意到几个月后，他被任命为部门主管。某一天我又注意到他成为了[国家工程院](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%99%A2)院士。我注意到他成功了。我再没听到曾经那个饭桌的其他同僚有谁在科学圈里被提到过。他们没有问自己，“我所在的领域里，什么才是重要的问题。”

If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, 'important problem' must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.

如果你不研究重要问题，你就不可能做出重要的工作。这是显而易见的。伟大的科学家们会仔细考虑各自领域里的诸多重要问题，并时刻留意如何去攻克它们。我需要提醒你们，“重要问题”必须认真定义。有三个著名的物理学问题，可以说贝尔实验室从来没研究过。”重要“的意思是说可以因此拿到诺贝尔奖和你所能想象得到的任何奖金数额。我们从来没有研究过：1. 时间旅行；2. 瞬间移动；3. 反重力。这些就不是重要问题，因为我们没法下手。让问题变得重要的不是因为最终结果，而是你有了一个可以解释的攻克方法。这方法才是让问题变得重要的原因。当我说大多数科学家没有工作在解决重要问题上时，我指的是这个意思。据我所知，平庸科学家几乎将所有时间都花在研究那些他认为不重要的问题上，他也不认为这些问题会导致重要的问题。

I spoke earlier about planting acorns so that oaks will grow. You can't always know exactly where to be, but you can keep active in places where something might happen. And even if you believe that great science is a matter of luck, you can stand on a mountain top where lightning strikes; you don't have to hide in the valley where you're safe. But the average scientist does routine safe work almost all the time and so he (or she) doesn't produce much. It's that simple. If you want to do great work, you clearly must work on important problems, and you should have an idea.

我刚才说过栽培种子长成橡树。你不可能总是确切知道该从哪里入手，但你可以在那些经常有事情的地方保持活动。哪怕你相信所谓伟大的科学研究其实就是撞运气，你也应该站在电闪雷鸣的山顶上，而不是躲在让你觉得安全的山谷里。平庸科学家几乎一直都在做例行的安全的研究，而产出很少。这很简单，如果你想做伟大的研究，显然你要研究那些重要问题，并且要有自己的想法。


Along those lines at some urging from John Tukey and others, I finally adopted what I called "Great Thoughts Time." When I went to lunch Friday noon, I would only discuss great thoughts after that. By great thoughts I mean ones like: "What will be the role of computers in all of AT&T?", "How will computers change science?" For example, I came up with the observation at that time that nine out of ten experiments were done in the lab and one in ten on the computer. I made a remark to the vice presidents one time, that it would be reversed, i.e. nine out of ten experiments would be done on the computer and one in ten in the lab. They knew I was a crazy mathematician and had no sense of reality. I knew they were wrong and they've been proved wrong while I have been proved right. They built laboratories when they didn't need them. I saw that computers were transforming science because I spent a lot of time asking "What will be the impact of computers on science and how can I change it?" I asked myself, "How is it going to change Bell Labs?" I remarked one time, in the same address, that more than one-half of the people at Bell Labs will be interacting closely with computing machines before I leave. Well, you all have terminals now. I thought hard about where was my field going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do. Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things.

在约翰·图基和其他人的 urging（鼓励/督促/促进/催促）  下，最终我采用了我称之为“重大思考时间”的方法。每周五吃完午饭后，我会专门只讨论重大思考。所谓重大思考，我指的是类似“在整个[AT&T](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T)中，计算机将扮演什么角色？”“计算机将如何改变科学？”
举个例子，我曾经注意到，有九成的试验是在实验室里、有一成是在计算机上完成的。有一次我对副总裁说，这事应该反过来，应该是九成实验在计算机上完成，剩下一成是在实验室里。他们知道我是个数学狂，缺乏现实感。我知道他们错了，当证明我对了的时候就会证明他们是错的。他们建造了根本不用不上的实验室。我见证了计算机正在改变科学，因为我花了很多时间思考“计算机将对科学产生什么样的影响，我会如何改变它？”我问自己，“它会如何改变贝尔实验室？”我在同样的地点又说过一次，在我离职前，贝尔实验室有超过一半以上的人会跟依赖计算机。现在你们可以看到结果了。我努力思考关于我所在领域的发展方向，哪里有机会，什么是值得解决的重要问题。朝着那个方向做下去我就有了解决重要问题的机会。

Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say "Well that bears on this problem." They drop all the other things and get after it. Now I can tell you a horror story that was told to me but I can't vouch for the truth of it. I was sitting in an airport talking to a friend of mine from Los Alamos about how it was lucky that the fission experiment occurred over in Europe when it did because that got us working on the atomic bomb here in the US. He said "No; at Berkeley we had gathered a bunch of data; we didn't get around to reducing it because we were building some more equipment, but if we had reduced that data we would have found fission." They had it in their hands and they didn't pursue it. They came in second!

大部分伟大科学家都知道很多重要问题。他们有 10 到 20 个重要问题在等着寻找攻克的方法。当他们有了新点子就会说：“这应该跟那个问题有关系。”之后他们就放下了所有其他事情，投入到那个新点子里。现在可以给你们讲个我听到的恐怖故事，但我无法保证真实性。我当时坐在候机厅，跟我一个在洛斯阿拉莫斯的朋友聊天。我说核裂变实验发生在欧洲实在是太幸运了，这样我们在美国也可以搞原子弹了。他说：“不是的。在伯克利我们收集了太多的数据。但没去归纳，因为我们在建造更多的设备。如果我们归纳了数据，应该就能发现核裂变了。”煮熟的鸭子就这么飞走了，机会转瞬即逝！

The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things. They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it. Now of course lots of times it doesn't work out, but you don't have to hit many of them to do some great science. It's kind of easy. One of the chief tricks is to live a long time!

伟大的科学家们，一旦机会来了，就会全身心投入并抓住机会。他们放下所有其他事情，摆脱了其他事物，去抓住那一个点子，因为他们已经想通了。他们的头脑已经做好准备。他们看到机会并抓住。当然有的点子可能花很多时间都无法解决，但是做伟大的科学研究不是要解决所有问题。这道理很简单，窍门就是活得久一点！

Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, "The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind." I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

另外一个 trait，我很久以后才注意到。我发现有人把门开着，有的喜欢关着门。我注意到如果你把办公室的门关着，你今天和明天就能完成更多的工作，生产力会比大部分人都高。但是十年后，你可能就不知道哪些问题是值得解决的了。你所有的努力都跟重要问题没什么关系。把门开着的人会受到各种干扰，但也会偶尔知道一些线索来了解这个世界怎么样了、有什么问题其实很重要。我无法证明这线索是否有因果关系，因为你可能会说：“把门关着意味着这人本身就思想封闭。”我不知道，但我可以说，敞开门和最终解决重要问题之间，存在明显的相关性。尽管把门关着的人通常工作得更加努力，但似乎做事的方式有些问题——不是很多，但足以错失成名的机会。

I want to talk on another topic. It is based on the song which I think many of you know, "It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it." I'll start with an example of my own. I was conned into doing on a digital computer, in the absolute binary days, a problem which the best analog computers couldn't do. And I was getting an answer. When I thought carefully and said to myself, "You know, Hamming, you're going to have to file a report on this military job; after you spend a lot of money you're going to have to account for it and every analog installation is going to want the report to see if they can't find flaws in it." I was doing the required integration by a rather crummy method, to say the least, but I was getting the answer. And I realized that in truth the problem was not just to get the answer; it was to demonstrate for the first time, and beyond question, that I could beat the analog computer on its own ground with a digital machine. I reworked the method of solution, created a theory which was nice and elegant, and changed the way we computed the answer; the results were no different. The published report had an elegant method which was later known for years as "Hamming's Method of Integrating Differential Equations." It is somewhat obsolete now, but for a while it was a very good method. By changing the problem slightly, I did important work rather than trivial work.

我想谈下另外一个话题。我想大家都听过的这首歌：“[不在于你做什么，而在于你怎么做](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Tain%27t_What_You_Do_%28It%27s_the_Way_That_You_Do_It%29)”我想从我自己的一个例子说起。为了处理严格的二进制，我沉迷于研究数字计算机，那个问题是最好的模拟计算机也无法解决的，我已经找到了答案。然后我认真思考并对自己说：“你知道的，汉明，于对这个军方项目你需要给一个文件报告，在你花了这么多钱之后，必须要做个陈述。而所有主张模拟计算机的人都等着找茬呢。”至少可以这样说，我在用一种相当糟糕的方式做了必要的积分演算。但是我找到答案了。而且我意识到这个问题不仅得到了答案。这就是它的第一次登场，已经超越了问题本身。我可以用数字计算机打败模拟计算机，在它自己的地盘。我重新设计了解决方法，创造了一个漂亮而优雅的理论，并修改了我们计算答案的方式。结果没有区别。公开报告里记录了一种优雅的算法，几年后被称之为“微积分方程中的海明法”。现在有点过时了，但是在当时曾经是一个很漂亮的算法。稍微改变了一下问题，我做出了重要的工作，而不是琐碎的工作。

In the same way, when using the machine up in the attic in the early days, I was solving one problem after another after another; a fair number were successful and there were a few failures. I went home one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously enough I wasn't happy; I was depressed. I could see life being a long sequence of one problem after another after another. After quite a while of thinking I decided, "No, I should be in the mass production of a variable product. I should be concerned with all of next year's problems, not just the one in front of my face." By changing the question I still got the same kind of results or better, but I changed things and did important work. I attacked the major problem - How do I conquer machines and do all of next year's problems when I don't know what they are going to be? How do I prepare for it? How do I do this one so I'll be on top of it? How do I obey Newton's rule? He said, "If I have seen further than others, it is because I've stood on the shoulders of giants." These days we stand on each other's feet!

类似的。以前在顶楼使用计算机的时候，我一次又一次、一次又一次的解决问题。大多数我都搞定了，也有一些失败了。某个周五，我搞定问题后回到家，很奇怪的是我不高兴，很沮丧。我可以看到生命被消耗在一个接一个、一个接一个的问题队列里。我思索了一阵子后决定，“不，我应该可以大量产出可变化的成果。我也应该关心明年所有的问题，而不止是我今年所面对的这些。在改变了问题后，我得到了同样的答案，或者更好。但我改变了事情并做了重要工作。我解决了主要问题，也就是，在我还不知道问题会怎样的时候，如何征服计算机，让他可以解决明年的问题？我该做什么样的准备？我如何能解决最顶端的那个问题？我是如何服从牛顿定律的？他说：“如果我看得更远，是因为我站在巨人的肩膀上。”而今，我们站在彼此的脚面上！

You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, "Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders and I saw further." The essence of science is cumulative. By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.

你可以按照这种方式来工作：让其他人可以在上面添砖加瓦，他们会真心实意地说：“是的，我站在某人的肩膀上，于是我看得更远了。”科学的本质是积累。稍微改变以下问题，你可以出大成就，而不仅仅是把工作做好。相对于攻克孤立的问题，除非是问题具有某一类共性，否则我绝不会去碰它。

Now if you are much of a mathematician you know that the effort to generalize often means that the solution is simple. Often by stopping and saying, "This is the problem he wants but this is characteristic of so and so. Yes, I can attack the whole class with a far superior method than the particular one because I was earlier embedded in needless detail." The business of abstraction frequently makes things simple. Furthermore, I filed away the methods and prepared for the future problems.

如果你很懂数学就会知道，下足功夫去归纳，意味着结论可以很简单。经常停下来说：“要解决的问题有这种或那种共性，好的，我可以用更优美的方式来攻克一类问题，而不是特定问题，不然我就会过早陷进细枝末节里。”抽象业务层经常可以让事情变得简单。此外，我放弃解决那些细枝末节，为了将来的问题而做准备。

To end this part, I'll remind you, "It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he can." And I suggest that by altering the problem, by looking at the thing differently, you can make a great deal of difference in your final productivity because you can either do it in such a fashion that people can indeed build on what you've done, or you can do it in such a fashion that the next person has to essentially duplicate again what you've done. It isn't just a matter of the job, it's the way you write the report, the way you write the paper, the whole attitude. It's just as easy to do a broad, general job as one very special case. And it's much more satisfying and rewarding!

最后一部分，让我提醒你们，“笨工匠总怪工具差。优秀的人才能胜任工作，尽其所能，得到自己能做到的最好的结果。”我建议通过改变问题，从不同角度看问题，可以极大的提高最终产出。要么让其他人的工作建立在你的成果之上，要么让下一个人再重复一遍你的工作。这不只关系到干活本身，也应该是你写报告的方式、写论文的方式，对任何事情的态度。像对待特殊情况一样去认真处理宽泛平常的工作，这让人舒服而且有益！

I have now come down to a topic which is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. 'Selling' to a scientist is an awkward thing to do. It's very ugly; you shouldn't have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come back and say, "Yes, that was good." I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others. You had better write your report so when it is published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won't just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours. If they don't stop and read it, you won't get credit.


我现在得聊一个让人不舒服的话题。单是做好一件事情还不够，你还得推销它。给一位科学家做“推销”是很尴尬的事情。这事很讨厌，你本来不需要做这个的。理想中的世界应该一直在等待着你做些伟大的事情，然后赶紧赞扬它。但事实上每个人都忙于自己的工作。你必须很好地阐述你的成果，好能让其他人把手头工作放一边，看看你做了什么，理解它，然后回过头来说，“是的，这很棒。”我建议，当你翻阅期刊的时候，要问自己为什么要读这些文章，而不是其他内容。你需要更认真地写报告，当被[物理评论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%A9%E7%90%86%E8%AF%84%E8%AE%BA)发表，或者随便发表到哪，应当让读者翻到这这页时，不会直接翻过去，而是能停下来阅读你的报告。如果他们没停下来读，你就不会获得声誉。

There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks. We had a lot of so-called 'back room scientists.' In a conference, they would keep quiet. Three weeks later after a decision was made they filed a report saying why you should do so and so. Well, it was too late. They would not stand up right in the middle of a hot conference, in the middle of activity, and say, "We should do this for these reasons." You need to master that form of communication as well as prepared speeches.

去做推销的时候，你要掌握三件事。你要学会清晰的写作，以方便人们阅读。你必须学会适当地做正式的演讲，你还必须学会做非正式的演讲。我们有很多所谓的“后排科学家“。在会议上，他们会保持沉默。在决定做出的三周后，他们提交了一份报告来解释你为什么要这样那样做。好吧，有点迟了。他们不会在一场热烈的会议里、在活动进行当中，站出来说：“我们应当这样做，因为有这些原因。”你需要掌握这样的沟通方式，并为此准备好演讲。

When I first started, I got practically physically ill while giving a speech, and I was very, very nervous. I realized I either had to learn to give speeches smoothly or I would essentially partially cripple my whole career. The first time IBM asked me to give a speech in New York one evening, I decided I was going to give a really good speech, a speech that was wanted, not a technical one but a broad one, and at the end if they liked it, I'd quietly say, "Any time you want one I'll come in and give you one." As a result, I got a great deal of practice giving speeches to a limited audience and I got over being afraid. Furthermore, I could also then study what methods were effective and what were ineffective.

当我最开始的时候，我在演讲的时候好像真的生病了一样，我非常非常紧张。我意识到，我要么学会做流利地发表演讲，要么我整个职业生涯都会受损。IBM 第一次邀请我做演讲，是在纽约的一个晚上。我决定要发表一场很棒的演讲，一场听众想要的演讲，不是纯技术的，而是更宽泛些的。演讲结束时，如果他们喜欢，我会从容地说：“任何时候，只要你们想要，我都可以过来演讲。”于是，我为做演讲做了大量练习，面对有限的听众，我克服了恐惧。此外，我还研究了哪些方法有效、哪些无效。

While going to meetings I had already been studying why some papers are remembered and most are not. The technical person wants to give a highly limited technical talk. Most of the time the audience wants a broad general talk and wants much more survey and background than the speaker is willing to give. As a result, many talks are ineffective. The speaker names a topic and suddenly plunges into the details he's solved. Few people in the audience may follow. You should paint a general picture to say why it's important, and then slowly give a sketch of what was done. Then a larger number of people will say, "Yes, Joe has done that," or "Mary has done that; I really see where it is; yes, Mary really gave a good talk; I understand what Mary has done." The tendency is to give a highly restricted, safe talk; this is usually ineffective. Furthermore, many talks are filled with far too much information. So I say this idea of selling is obvious.

通过参加会议我学到了，为什么有些论文被人记住了，但大多数都没有。搞技术的人希望做更局限于技术本身的演讲。通常听众们想要的是更宽泛的一般性演讲，想要更多演讲者没提供的调查和背景信息。于是，很多演讲都是无效的。演讲者列举了一个主题，然后就突然陷进他所解决的技术细节里了。听众里很少有人能跟上思路。你需要画一张大饼来解释为什么这个问题很重要，然后慢慢给作成的事情画出轮廓。这样就有更多人会说：“懂了，张三已经做成了”或者“李四已经做成了。我明白是怎么回事了。没错，李四做了一场很棒的演讲。我知道李四是怎么做的了。”现在的趋势是做一场高门槛、安全的演讲，这通常是无效的。太多的演讲里充斥了过量的信息。所以我说的这个推销的方法是显而易见的。

Let me summarize. You've got to work on important problems. I deny that it is all luck, but I admit there is a fair element of luck. I subscribe to Pasteur's "Luck favors the prepared mind." I favor heavily what I did. Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time trying to understand the bigger problems in the field, i.e. what was and what was not important. I found in the early days I had believed 'this' and yet had spent all week marching in 'that' direction. It was kind of foolish. If I really believe the action is over there, why do I march in this direction? I either had to change my goal or change what I did. So I changed something I did and I marched in the direction I thought was important. It's that easy.

让我总结一下，你应该去解决重要的问题。我不认为这全靠运气，但我也承认确实要碰点运气。我赞成巴斯德的“好运会眷顾有准备的人”。我非常喜欢我所做的，这些年来每周五下午，专门进行重大思考。这意味着我花了全部时间的十分之一，去尝试理解领域里的更大的问题。比方说，什么重要什么不重要。我发现早些时候我相信“这个”，然后每周都朝着“那个”方向行进。这看起来有点傻。我确信自己不再这么做了。为什么我要朝这个方向行进？我要么改变目标，要么改变手头的工作。所以我调整了所做的事情，朝着我认为是重要的那个方向行进。就这么简单。

Now you might tell me you haven't got control over what you have to work on. Well, when you first begin, you may not. But once you're moderately successful, there are more people asking for results than you can deliver and you have some power of choice, but not completely. I'll tell you a story about that, and it bears on the subject of educating your boss. I had a boss named Schelkunoff; he was, and still is, a very good friend of mine. Some military person came to me and demanded some answers by Friday. Well, I had already dedicated my computing resources to reducing data on the fly for a group of scientists; I was knee deep in short, small, important problems. This military person wanted me to solve his problem by the end of the day on Friday. I said, "No, I'll give it to you Monday. I can work on it over the weekend. I'm not going to do it now." He goes down to my boss, Schelkunoff, and Schelkunoff says, "You must run this for him; he's got to have it by Friday." I tell him, "Why do I?"; he says, "You have to." I said, "Fine, Sergei, but you're sitting in your office Friday afternoon catching the late bus home to watch as this fellow walks out that door." I gave the military person the answers late Friday afternoon. I then went to Schelkunoff's office and sat down; as the man goes out I say, "You see Schelkunoff, this fellow has nothing under his arm; but I gave him the answers." On Monday morning Schelkunoff called him up and said, "Did you come in to work over the weekend?" I could hear, as it were, a pause as the fellow ran through his mind of what was going to happen; but he knew he would have had to sign in, and he'd better not say he had when he hadn't, so he said he hadn't. Ever after that Schelkunoff said, "You set your deadlines; you can change them."

现在你可能告诉我，你没能把控住要做什么。好吧，刚入行的时候你可能还把控不了。但只要你取得一次适当的成功，等人们索要的结果超过了你所能提供的，你就有权做选择了，虽然不是全部权力。关于这事我可以讲个故事，这涉及到如何教育你的老板。我曾经一位老板叫[谢昆诺夫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Alexander_Schelkunoff)，他曾经是、现在也依然是我的好朋友。有一次军方的人来找我，要求我周五之前给出答案。其实，我已经将我的计算机资源用于为一群科学家实时归纳数据了。我当时正沉浸于短小而重要的问题上。这个军方的人却想让我周五就解决他的问题。我说，“不，我周一再给你。我可以周末做完，但我现在不能去搞。”他就去找我老板，谢昆诺夫，于是谢昆诺夫跟我说：“你必须给他们做这事，他必须在周五拿到。”我说：“我为什么要做？”他说：“你就是得做。”我说，“好吧，谢尔盖，但是你要在周五下午坐在办公室里，赶最后一班公交车回家。这样你可以看到这家伙走出大门。”我周五下午给了军方的人那些答案，然后去谢昆诺夫的办公室坐下，等那个人出去的时候我说：“你看，谢昆诺夫，这家伙胳膊下面什么都没有夹，但是我已经给过他答案了。”周一早上谢昆诺夫叫住那人说：“你上周末过来加班了么？”我能听到，也能知道发生了什么：这家伙愣了一下，绞尽脑汁在想应该怎么回答。但是他知道进来是需要登记的，他要没登记过最好别说自己来过。他只好说没来加班。在那之后，谢昆诺夫说，“你自己设定期限，怎么调整你说了算。“

One lesson was sufficient to educate my boss as to why I didn't want to do big jobs that displaced exploratory research and why I was justified in not doing crash jobs which absorb all the research computing facilities. I wanted instead to use the facilities to compute a large number of small problems. Again, in the early days, I was limited in computing capacity and it was clear, in my area, that a "mathematician had no use for machines." But I needed more machine capacity. Every time I had to tell some scientist in some other area, "No I can't; I haven't the machine capacity," he complained. I said "Go tell your Vice President that Hamming needs more computing capacity." After a while I could see what was happening up there at the top; many people said to my Vice President, "Your man needs more computing capacity." I got it!

一堂课足以教育我的老板，为什么我不想去搞什么大项目来取代探索性的研究工作，为什么我理直气壮不去搞那些要消耗所有科研计算设备的破烂任务。相反，我希望用这些设备来计算大量的小问题。再说一句，早些时候，我的计算配额受限制，当时很明显，在我的领域，都觉得“数学家用不上计算机”。但我需要更多的计算配额。每次我得去求其他领域的科学家们。他们会抱怨：“不行，我没有没有计算配额。”我就说：“告诉副总裁，汉明需要更多的计算配额。”过了一段时间，我开始能看出效果了。很多人跟我的副总裁说，“你那个手下需要更多计算配额。”我得到了！

I also did a second thing. When I loaned what little programming power we had to help in the early days of computing, I said, "We are not getting the recognition for our programmers that they deserve. When you publish a paper you will thank that programmer or you aren't getting any more help from me. That programmer is going to be thanked by name; she's worked hard." I waited a couple of years. I then went through a year of BSTJ articles and counted what fraction thanked some programmer. I took it into the boss and said, "That's the central role computing is playing in Bell Labs; if the BSTJ is important, that's how important computing is." He had to give in. You can educate your bosses. It's a hard job. In this talk I'm only viewing from the bottom up; I'm not viewing from the top down. But I am telling you how you can get what you want in spite of top management. You have to sell your ideas there also.

我还做了第二件事。在早期我们需要得到计算上的帮助时，我借到一点编程资源。我说：“我们没有表示出对程序员们的认可。当你们发表论文时，应该考虑一下那位程序员，否则以后就没法再得到他们的帮助了。程序员应该被点名感谢。她工作得很努力。”过了几年，我浏览了一年的[《贝尔实验室技术期刊》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs_Technical_Journal)，记录了对某些程序员的感谢程度，并带给老板看，然后说：“那就是计算在贝尔实验室中扮演的核心角色。《贝尔实验室技术期刊》有多重要，计算就有多重要。”他只好让步。你可以教育你的老板，这是个艰巨的人物。这次演讲我只从下往上看，而不是从上往下看。我想告诉你们的是，如何得到你想要的，尽管领导们可能并不乐意。你还是得推销你的想法。

Well I now come down to the topic, "Is the effort to be a great scientist worth it?" To answer this, you must ask people. When you get beyond their modesty, most people will say, "Yes, doing really first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine, women and song put together," or if it's a woman she says, "It is as good as wine, men and song put together." And if you look at the bosses, they tend to come back or ask for reports, trying to participate in those moments of discovery. They're always in the way. So evidently those who have done it, want to do it again. But it is a limited survey. I have never dared to go out and ask those who didn't do great work how they felt about the matter. It's a biased sample, but I still think it is worth the struggle. I think it is very definitely worth the struggle to try and do first-class work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle more than it is in the result. The struggle to make something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my opinion.

现在我要回到主题。“成就一名伟大科学家所付出的努力值得吗？”想回答这问题，你得问问其他人。在他们谦逊的背后，大部分人应该会说：“是的，做真正一流的研究，掌握它，就好像把红酒、美人和音乐放在一起享受一样美好。”或者换成女士可能会说“就像把红酒、俊男和音乐放在一起享受一样美好。“ 如果留意你们的老板，就会发现，他们都想着回来做研究，或者推敲报告，试图参与那些做出重大发现的时刻。他们总是在忙碌，显然这些做成过大事的人们，想再成功一次。但这是一项有限的调查，我没敢去问那些没做出伟大工作的人们，对此是什么感受。这是个有偏见的样本，但我依然认为努力奋斗是值得的。我认为尝试做一流的工作是绝对值得的，因为真相是，奋斗本身的价值比结果更大。为自己的事情而努力，这看起来很划算。在我看来，成功和名望是都是添头。

I've told you how to do it. It is so easy, so why do so many people, with all their talents, fail? For example, my opinion, to this day, is that there are in the mathematics department at Bell Labs quite a few people far more able and far better endowed than I, but they didn't produce as much. Some of them did produce more than I did; Shannon produced more than I did, and some others produced a lot, but I was highly productive against a lot of other fellows who were better equipped. Why is it so? What happened to them? Why do so many of the people who have great promise, fail?

我跟你们说了应该如何做，这是如此简单。可为什么有那么多人，才华横溢，却失败了？举个例子，在我看来，直到目前，贝尔实验室的数学系有不少人能力比我强、天赋比我好，却没有我这么多产出。他们中有一些人产出比我多，香农比我产出多，还有一些人产出也很多，但相比很多装备精良的同事，我比他们的效率高很多。为什么会这样，在他们身上发生了什么？为什么这么多人前程似锦，然后失败了？

Well, one of the reasons is drive and commitment. The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day. They don't have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for really first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but we were talking, remember, about first-class work. There is a difference. Good people, very talented people, almost always turn out good work. We're talking about the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the Nobel Prize and gets recognition.

The second thing is, I think, the problem of personality defects. Now I'll cite a fellow whom I met out in Irvine. He had been the head of a computing center and he was temporarily on assignment as a special assistant to the president of the university. It was obvious he had a job with a great future. He took me into his office one time and showed me his method of getting letters done and how he took care of his correspondence. He pointed out how inefficient the secretary was. He kept all his letters stacked around there; he knew where everything was. And he would, on his word processor, get the letter out. He was bragging how marvelous it was and how he could get so much more work done without the secretary's interference. Well, behind his back, I talked to the secretary. The secretary said, "Of course I can't help him; I don't get his mail. He won't give me the stuff to log in; I don't know where he puts it on the floor. Of course I can't help him." So I went to him and said, "Look, if you adopt the present method and do what you can do single-handedly, you can go just that far and no farther than you can do single-handedly. If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support you." And, he never went any further. He had his personality defect of wanting total control and was not willing to recognize that you need the support of the system.

You find this happening again and again; good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a decision 'No', you just go to your boss and get a 'No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you 'No'. But if you want a 'No', it's easy to get a 'No'.

Another personality defect is ego assertion and I'll speak in this case of my own experience. I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure. You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, "Why? No Vice President at IBM said, 'Give Hamming a bad time'. It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I haven't mistreated them." Answer, I wasn't dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that - I wasn't dressing properly. I had to make the decision - was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better? I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.

You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.

John Tukey almost always dressed very casually. He would go into an important office and it would take a long time before the other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better listen. For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of hostility. It's wasted effort! I didn't say you should conform; I said "The appearance of conforming gets you a long way." If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, "I am going to do it my way," you pay a small steady price throughout the whole of your professional career. And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble.

By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For instance, one time for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at Murray Hill were tied up. Don't ask me how, but they were. I wanted something done. My secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped the company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it reproduced, and then came back. It was a payoff for the times I had made an effort to cheer her up, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work that later paid off for me. By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.

And I think John Tukey paid a terrible price needlessly. He was a genius anyhow, but I think it would have been far better, and far simpler, had he been willing to conform a little bit instead of ego asserting. He is going to dress the way he wants all of the time. It applies not only to dress but to a thousand other things; people will continue to fight the system. Not that you shouldn't occasionally!

When they moved the library from the middle of Murray Hill to the far end, a friend of mine put in a request for a bicycle. Well, the organization was not dumb. They waited awhile and sent back a map of the grounds saying, "Will you please indicate on this map what paths you are going to take so we can get an insurance policy covering you." A few more weeks went by. They then asked, "Where are you going to store the bicycle and how will it be locked so we can do so and so." He finally realized that of course he was going to be red-taped to death so he gave in. He rose to be the President of Bell Laboratories.

Barney Oliver was a good man. He wrote a letter one time to the IEEE. At that time the official shelf space at Bell Labs was so much and the height of the IEEE Proceedings at that time was larger; and since you couldn't change the size of the official shelf space he wrote this letter to the IEEE Publication person saying, "Since so many IEEE members were at Bell Labs and since the official space was so high the journal size should be changed." He sent it for his boss's signature. Back came a carbon with his signature, but he still doesn't know whether the original was sent or not. I am not saying you shouldn't make gestures of reform. I am saying that my study of able people is that they don't get themselves committed to that kind of warfare. They play it a little bit and drop it and get on with their work.

Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system. My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class scientist.

On the other hand, we can't always give in. There are times when a certain amount of rebellion is sensible. I have observed almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting the system for the sheer love of it. What it comes down to basically is that you cannot be original in one area without having originality in others. Originality is being different. You can't be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics. But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets. I'm not against all ego assertion; I'm against some.

Another fault is anger. Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger is misdirected. You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the system all the time.

Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative. I have already given you several examples, and there are many, many more; how, given the situation, by changing the way I looked at it, I converted what was apparently a defect to an asset. I'll give you another example. I am an egotistical person; there is no doubt about it. I knew that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book, didn't finish it on time. So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done - I'd have been ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I'd have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say, "Oh yes, I'll get the answer for you Tuesday," not having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I'm surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.

Now self-delusion in humans is very, very common. There are enumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding yourself and making it look some other way. When you ask, "Why didn't you do such and such," the person has a thousand alibis. If you look at the history of science, usually these days there are 10 people right there ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first. The other nine fellows say, "Well, I had the idea but I didn't do it and so on and so on." There are so many alibis. Why weren't you first? Why didn't you do it right? Don't try an alibi. Don't try and kid yourself. You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don't mind. But to yourself try to be honest.

If you really want to be a first-class scientist you need to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and your bad faults, like my egotism. How can you convert a fault to an asset? How can you convert a situation where you haven't got enough manpower to move into a direction when that's exactly what you need to do? I say again that I have seen, as I studied the history, the successful scientist changed the viewpoint and what was a defect became an asset.

In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!

(End of the formal part of the talk.)

## DISCUSSION - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

A. G. Chynoweth: Well that was 50 minutes of concentrated wisdom and observations accumulated over a fantastic career; I lost track of all the observations that were striking home. Some of them are very very timely. One was the plea for more computer capacity; I was hearing nothing but that this morning from several people, over and over again. So that was right on the mark today even though here we are 20 - 30 years after when you were making similar remarks, Dick. I can think of all sorts of lessons that all of us can draw from your talk. And for one, as I walk around the halls in the future I hope I won't see as many closed doors in Bellcore. That was one observation I thought was very intriguing.

Thank you very, very much indeed Dick; that was a wonderful recollection. I'll now open it up for questions. I'm sure there are many people who would like to take up on some of the points that Dick was making.

Hamming: First let me respond to Alan Chynoweth about computing. I had computing in research and for 10 years I kept telling my management, "Get that !&@#% machine out of research. We are being forced to run problems all the time. We can't do research because were too busy operating and running the computing machines." Finally the message got through. They were going to move computing out of research to someplace else. I was persona non grata to say the least and I was surprised that people didn't kick my shins because everybody was having their toy taken away from them. I went in to Ed David's office and said, "Look Ed, you've got to give your researchers a machine. If you give them a great big machine, we'll be back in the same trouble we were before, so busy keeping it going we can't think. Give them the smallest machine you can because they are very able people. They will learn how to do things on a small machine instead of mass computing." As far as I'm concerned, that's how UNIX arose. We gave them a moderately small machine and they decided to make it do great things. They had to come up with a system to do it on. It is called UNIX!

A. G. Chynoweth: I just have to pick up on that one. In our present environment, Dick, while we wrestle with some of the red tape attributed to, or required by, the regulators, there is one quote that one exasperated AVP came up with and I've used it over and over again. He growled that, "UNIX was never a deliverable!"

Question: What about personal stress? Does that seem to make a difference?

Hamming: Yes, it does. If you don't get emotionally involved, it doesn't. I had incipient ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs. I have since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if you want to be a great scientist you're going to have to put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said. If you want to lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and everything else, you'll lead a nice life.

Question: The remarks about having courage, no one could argue with; but those of us who have gray hairs or who are well established don't have to worry too much. But what I sense among the young people these days is a real concern over the risk taking in a highly competitive environment. Do you have any words of wisdom on this?

Hamming: I'll quote Ed David more. Ed David was concerned about the general loss of nerve in our society. It does seem to me that we've gone through various periods. Coming out of the war, coming out of Los Alamos where we built the bomb, coming out of building the radars and so on, there came into the mathematics department, and the research area, a group of people with a lot of guts. They've just seen things done; they've just won a war which was fantastic. We had reasons for having courage and therefore we did a great deal. I can't arrange that situation to do it again. I cannot blame the present generation for not having it, but I agree with what you say; I just cannot attach blame to it. It doesn't seem to me they have the desire for greatness; they lack the courage to do it. But we had, because we were in a favorable circumstance to have it; we just came through a tremendously successful war. In the war we were looking very, very bad for a long while; it was a very desperate struggle as you well know. And our success, I think, gave us courage and self confidence; that's why you see, beginning in the late forties through the fifties, a tremendous productivity at the labs which was stimulated from the earlier times. Because many of us were earlier forced to learn other things - we were forced to learn the things we didn't want to learn, we were forced to have an open door - and then we could exploit those things we learned. It is true, and I can't do anything about it; I cannot blame the present generation either. It's just a fact.

Question: Is there something management could or should do?

Hamming: Management can do very little. If you want to talk about managing research, that's a totally different talk. I'd take another hour doing that. This talk is about how the individual gets very successful research done in spite of anything the management does or in spite of any other opposition. And how do you do it? Just as I observe people doing it. It's just that simple and that hard!

Question: Is brainstorming a daily process?

Hamming: Once that was a very popular thing, but it seems not to have paid off. For myself I find it desirable to talk to other people; but a session of brainstorming is seldom worthwhile. I do go in to strictly talk to somebody and say, "Look, I think there has to be something here. Here's what I think I see ..." and then begin talking back and forth. But you want to pick capable people. To use another analogy, you know the idea called the 'critical mass.' If you have enough stuff you have critical mass. There is also the idea I used to call 'sound absorbers'. When you get too many sound absorbers, you give out an idea and they merely say, "Yes, yes, yes." What you want to do is get that critical mass in action; "Yes, that reminds me of so and so," or, "Have you thought about that or this?" When you talk to other people, you want to get rid of those sound absorbers who are nice people but merely say, "Oh yes," and to find those who will stimulate you right back.

For example, you couldn't talk to John Pierce without being stimulated very quickly. There were a group of other people I used to talk with. For example there was Ed Gilbert; I used to go down to his office regularly and ask him questions and listen and come back stimulated. I picked my people carefully with whom I did or whom I didn't brainstorm because the sound absorbers are a curse. They are just nice guys; they fill the whole space and they contribute nothing except they absorb ideas and the new ideas just die away instead of echoing on. Yes, I find it necessary to talk to people. I think people with closed doors fail to do this so they fail to get their ideas sharpened, such as "Did you ever notice something over here?" I never knew anything about it - I can go over and look. Somebody points the way. On my visit here, I have already found several books that I must read when I get home. I talk to people and ask questions when I think they can answer me and give me clues that I do not know about. I go out and look!

Question: What kind of tradeoffs did you make in allocating your time for reading and writing and actually doing research?

Hamming: I believed, in my early days, that you should spend at least as much time in the polish and presentation as you did in the original research. Now at least 50% of the time must go for the presentation. It's a big, big number.

Question: How much effort should go into library work?

Hamming: It depends upon the field. I will say this about it. There was a fellow at Bell Labs, a very, very, smart guy. He was always in the library; he read everything. If you wanted references, you went to him and he gave you all kinds of references. But in the middle of forming these theories, I formed a proposition: there would be no effect named after him in the long run. He is now retired from Bell Labs and is an Adjunct Professor. He was very valuable; I'm not questioning that. He wrote some very good Physical Review articles; but there's no effect named after him because he read too much. If you read all the time what other people have done you will think the way they thought. If you want to think new thoughts that are different, then do what a lot of creative people do - get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look at any answers until you've thought the problem through carefully how you would do it, how you could slightly change the problem to be the correct one. So yes, you need to keep up. You need to keep up more to find out what the problems are than to read to find the solutions. The reading is necessary to know what is going on and what is possible. But reading to get the solutions does not seem to be the way to do great research. So I'll give you two answers. You read; but it is not the amount, it is the way you read that counts.

Question: How do you get your name attached to things?

Hamming: By doing great work. I'll tell you the hamming window one. I had given Tukey a hard time, quite a few times, and I got a phone call from him from Princeton to me at Murray Hill. I knew that he was writing up power spectra and he asked me if I would mind if he called a certain window a "Hamming window." And I said to him, "Come on, John; you know perfectly well I did only a small part of the work but you also did a lot." He said, "Yes, Hamming, but you contributed a lot of small things; you're entitled to some credit." So he called it the hamming window. Now, let me go on. I had twitted John frequently about true greatness. I said true greatness is when your name is like ampere, watt, and fourier - when it's spelled with a lower case letter. That's how the hamming window came about.

Question: Dick, would you care to comment on the relative effectiveness between giving talks, writing papers, and writing books?

Hamming: In the short-haul, papers are very important if you want to stimulate someone tomorrow. If you want to get recognition long-haul, it seems to me writing books is more contribution because most of us need orientation. In this day of practically infinite knowledge, we need orientation to find our way. Let me tell you what infinite knowledge is. Since from the time of Newton to now, we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17 years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field now. It isn't going to happen. The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools. I believe that books which try to digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things the future generations will value. Public talks are necessary; private talks are necessary; written papers are necessary. But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out what's not essential are more important than books which tell you everything because you don't want to know everything. I don't want to know that much about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.

Question: You mentioned the problem of the Nobel Prize and the subsequent notoriety of what was done to some of the careers. Isn't that kind of a much more broad problem of fame? What can one do?

Hamming: Some things you could do are the following. Somewhere around every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field. Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to hardware, to software, and so on, periodically, because you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new field, you have to start over as a baby. You are no longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there and you can start planting those acorns which will become the giant oaks. Shannon, I believe, ruined himself. In fact when he left Bell Labs, I said, "That's the end of Shannon's scientific career." I received a lot of flak from my friends who said that Shannon was just as smart as ever. I said, "Yes, he'll be just as smart, but that's the end of his scientific career," and I truly believe it was.

You have to change. You get tired after a while; you use up your originality in one field. You need to get something nearby. I'm not saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics to English literature; I mean within your field you should shift areas so that you don't go stale. You couldn't get away with forcing a change every seven years, but if you could, I would require a condition for doing research, being that you will change your field of research every seven years with a reasonable definition of what it means, or at the end of 10 years, management has the right to compel you to change. I would insist on a change because I'm serious. What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it. They were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There's the new direction; but the old fellows are still marching in their former direction.

You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and before you use up all the old ones. You can do something about this, but it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say, "Yes, I will give up my great reputation." For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said, "Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are going to try and do something else other than coast on that." I deliberately refused to go on in that field. I wouldn't even read papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do something else. I managed myself, which is what I'm preaching in this whole talk. Knowing many of my own faults, I manage myself. I have a lot of faults, so I've got a lot of problems, i.e. a lot of possibilities of management.

Question: Would you compare research and management?

Hamming: If you want to be a great researcher, you won't make it being president of the company. If you want to be president of the company, that's another thing. I'm not against being president of the company. I just don't want to be. I think Ian Ross does a good job as President of Bell Labs. I'm not against it; but you have to be clear on what you want. Furthermore, when you're young, you may have picked wanting to be a great scientist, but as you live longer, you may change your mind. For instance, I went to my boss, Bode, one day and said, "Why did you ever become department head? Why didn't you just be a good scientist?" He said, "Hamming, I had a vision of what mathematics should be in Bell Laboratories. And I saw if that vision was going to be realized, I had to make it happen; I had to be department head." When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management. And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management you have to go. If you have a vision of what the whole laboratory should be, or the whole Bell System, you have to get there to make it happen. You can't make it happen from the bottom very easily. It depends upon what goals and what desires you have. And as they change in life, you have to be prepared to change. I chose to avoid management because I preferred to do what I could do single-handedly. But that's the choice that I made, and it is biased. Each person is entitled to their choice. Keep an open mind. But when you do choose a path, for heaven's sake be aware of what you have done and the choice you have made. Don't try to do both sides.

Question: How important is one's own expectation or how important is it to be in a group or surrounded by people who expect great work from you?

Hamming: At Bell Labs everyone expected good work from me - it was a big help. Everybody expects you to do a good job, so you do, if you've got pride. I think it's very valuable to have first-class people around. I sought out the best people. The moment that physics table lost the best people, I left. The moment I saw that the same was true of the chemistry table, I left. I tried to go with people who had great ability so I could learn from them and who would expect great results out of me. By deliberately managing myself, I think I did much better than laissez faire.

Question: You, at the outset of your talk, minimized or played down luck; but you seemed also to gloss over the circumstances that got you to Los Alamos, that got you to Chicago, that got you to Bell Laboratories.

Hamming: There was some luck. On the other hand I don't know the alternate branches. Until you can say that the other branches would not have been equally or more successful, I can't say. Is it luck the particular thing you do? For example, when I met Feynman at Los Alamos, I knew he was going to get a Nobel Prize. I didn't know what for. But I knew darn well he was going to do great work. No matter what directions came up in the future, this man would do great work. And sure enough, he did do great work. It isn't that you only do a little great work at this circumstance and that was luck, there are many opportunities sooner or later. There are a whole pail full of opportunities, of which, if you're in this situation, you seize one and you're great over there instead of over here. There is an element of luck, yes and no. Luck favors a prepared mind; luck favors a prepared person. It is not guaranteed; I don't guarantee success as being absolutely certain. I'd say luck changes the odds, but there is some definite control on the part of the individual.

Go forth, then, and do great work!

## BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF RICHARD HAMMING

Richard W. Hamming was born February 11, 1915, in Chicago, Illinois. His formal education was marked by the following degrees (all in mathematics): B.S. 1937, University of Chicago; M.A. 1939, University of Nebraska; and Ph.D. 1942, University of Illinois. His early experience was obtained at Los Alamos 1945-1946, i.e. at the close of World War II, where he managed the computers used in building the first atomic bomb. From there he went directly to Bell Laboratories where he spent thirty years in various aspects of computing, numerical analysis, and management of computing, i.e. 1946-1976. On July 23, 1976 he 'moved his office' to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California where he taught, supervised research, and wrote books.

While at Bell Laboratories, he took time to teach in Universities, sometimes locally and sometimes on a full sabbatical leave; these activities included visiting professorships at New York University, Princeton University (Statistics), City College of New York, Stanford University, 1960-61, Stevens Institute of Technology (Mathematics), and the University of California, Irvine, 1970-71.

Richard Hamming has received a number of awards which include: Fellow, IEEE, 1968; the ACM Turing Prize, 1968; the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award, 1979; Member, National Academy of Engineering, 1980; and the Harold Pender Award, U. Penn., 1981. In 1987 a major IEEE award was named after him, namely the Richard W. Hamming Medal, "For exceptional contributions to information sciences and systems"; fittingly, he was also the first recipient of this award, 1988. In 1996 in Munich he received the prestigious $130,000 Eduard Rhein Award for Achievement in Technology for his work on error correcting codes. He was both a Founder and Past President of ACM, and a Vice Pres. of the AAAS Mathematics Section.

He is probably best known for his pioneering work on error-correcting codes, his work on integrating differential equations, and the spectral window which bears his name. His extensive writing has included a number of important, pioneering, and highly regarded books. These are:

* Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, McGraw-Hill, 1962; Second edition 1973; Reprinted by Dover 1985; Translated into Russian.
* Calculus and the Computer Revolution, Houghton-Mifflin, 1968.
* Introduction to Applied Numerical Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1971.
* Computers and Society, McGraw-Hill, 1972.
* Digital Filters, Prentice-Hall, 1977; Second edition 1983; Third edition 1989; translated into several European languages.
* Coding and Information Theory, Prentice-Hall, 1980; Second edition 1986.
* Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability and Statistics, Prentice-Hall, 1985.
* The Art of Probability for Scientists and Engineers, Addison-Wesley, 1991.
* The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn, Gordon and Breach, 1997.
* He continued a very active life as Adjunct Professor, teaching and writing in the Mathematics and Computer Science Departments at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California for another twenty-one years before he retired to become Professor Emeritus in 1997. He was still teaching a course in the fall of 1997. He passed away unexpectedly on January 7, 1998.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I would like to acknowledge the professional efforts of Donna Paradise of the Word Processing Center who did the initial transcription of the talk from the tape recording. She made my job of editing much easier. The errors of sentence parsing and punctuation are mine and mine alone. Finally I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Richard Hamming and Alan Chynoweth for all of their help in bringing this transcription to its present readable state.
